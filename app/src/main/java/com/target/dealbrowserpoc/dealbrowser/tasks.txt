List of tasks by priority

* Add dagger2 for dependencies
* Add ButterKnife
* Connect to RemoteService for items - us RX for async
* Convert to RecyclerView - use Picasso or other image handling for background url loading
* Modify deal_list_item to match mock-up
* Create detail Activity/Fragment - should match mock-up

  *Optional Ideas*
* Create wide layout to show list detail in main view for tablets
* Move to a MVP architecture (or try new Android Architecture Contents ViewModel)
  Add some unit tests - app is pretty basic but should be able to come up with a few
    ** Having issues configuring JUnit - skipping for now.
* Transition animations?
  Try Grid toggle - think this is simple with RecyclerView - just change LayoutManager to GridLayoutManager
  Use data binding
